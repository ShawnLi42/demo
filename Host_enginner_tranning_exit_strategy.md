# ESTE Training Curriculum — Exit Strategy

## 1. Purpose
This exit strategy outlines the process for concluding the development and deployment of the **HOST Engineer ESTE Training Curriculum**.  
The curriculum is designed to onboard **Level 1 HOST Engineers** by providing a comprehensive understanding of the ESTE system.

---

## 2. Completion Criteria
The curriculum will be considered complete when:

- ✅ All **17 sections** are finalized and integrated.
- ✅ Learning objectives are clearly defined and aligned across sections.
- ✅ Any remaining structural gaps from the original curriculum are addressed.
- ✅ Planned demonstrations *(e.g., MS Copilot or other tech tools)* are completed or scheduled.

---

## 3. Ownership and Maintenance
Post-completion, the **ARTE Engineering team** will retain full ownership of the curriculum.  
Responsibilities include:

- Ongoing updates and modifications.
- Incorporating feedback from future cohorts.
- Adding new content as ESTE system capabilities evolve.

---

## 4. Knowledge Transfer
No formal knowledge transfer is required, as the **ARTE team** will continue to manage and maintain the curriculum internally.

---

## 5. Risk Mitigation
**Primary Risk:** Lack of review by senior development team members.  
**Mitigation Plan:**
- Propose a review session with senior developers before final rollout.
- Establish feedback loops for iterative improvements post-launch.

---

## 6. Stakeholder Communication
Key stakeholders *(e.g., HOST onboarding leads, ARTE team members, and possibly senior developers)* will be informed of the curriculum’s completion via:

- A summary report of changes and additions.
- A walkthrough or demo session if needed.
- A shared repository of finalized materials.

---

## 7. Timeline
The exit process is expected to **begin in late 2025** and **conclude by early 2026**.
